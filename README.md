It's a bunch of programmers and innovators in a decentralized production environment, I'm just formal     I keep a third of the value of the project as a founder. This is only here and the rest equally. We are all the same. I reserve the rights to your founder ka.     Don't make a decision that not everyone has voted on     The interconnected sites to be opened     Many things, for example: Selling money that you do not have on the Internet     Devices invented to be in a stimulating environment     Or create a program unlike it     The most important thing is that the proportions are equal and the minds think well.  We bring something good.  I have a lot of ideas.  I want to see startups as well as entry status.  Or acquisition or development.  The idea     We also take care of legal matters: we will take care of every detail     And equal proportions between the team.  Nobody gets confused online.  It takes more or less than the other.  The property registration here has created an environment that helps you to think about exporting and importing minerals in threatening quantities or foodstuffs in deals under the management of the team. Several positions will be voted on, including public relations.
